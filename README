<h1>Hello Box</h1>
<p>By the Summit Changemakers</p>
<h2>Project Outline<h2>

Many people experience loneliness. Overcoming this can be daunting, but the first step to breaking anyone's isolation is to exchange a simple hello.
The hello box is a kiosks that Co-Op customers can interact with to take part in a national, compost conversation, starting with a simple “hello”  exchanged with strangers progressing to a simple bot driven conversation, letting them know that they are not alone.

<h2>Kiosk</h2>
This is dependent on Python 3, PHP5 and needs curl and wget.
